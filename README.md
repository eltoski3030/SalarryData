# WorkAround Study Project

## Project Description

This project is a study-based web application designed to provide insights into salary data across different roles and companies. It's an interactive tool where users can select specific roles and companies to view the average salaries and compare them against industry standards.

Currently, the project is experiencing issues with the JavaScript files rendering correctly. This is likely due to pathing issues or module import/export discrepancies. 
The HTML and CSS portions are functioning, but the dynamic content driven by JavaScript is not displaying as intended.
